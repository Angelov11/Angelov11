# 👋 Hi, I’m Ivan Angelov

I’m a **software developer** who enjoys turning complex problems into clean, scalable solutions.  
Most of my work lives at the intersection of **backend systems, integrations, and developer experience** — with a growing love for mobile apps and product thinking.

I care about:
- building things that *actually run in production*  
- writing code that future-me won’t hate  
- automation, reliability, and clear data flows

## 🧠 What I’m working on

- 📱 **Mobile apps** using React Native & Expo  
- ⚙️ **Backend systems** in Node.js & Python  
- ☁️ **Cloud-native architectures** (AWS, serverless, CI/CD)  
- 🔐 Secure APIs (mTLS, OAuth, webhooks, integrations)  
- 📊 Data-driven features, analytics & dashboards
- 💬 **Slack integrations** in Node.js

I tend to work on projects that start small… and accidentally grow into real products.

## 🚀 How I like to work

- Automate boring things  
- Ship, measure, improve  

I enjoy refactoring messy systems into something calm, predictable, and well-documented.
